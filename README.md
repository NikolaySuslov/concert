## Description

Another perspective to what we normally (don't) see. The bowing after coming to the stage; the tuning of the instrument; the playing itself; the applause (?).  
As always, but different.  
The art work is presented in the form of interactive, multi-user, collaborative p2p web application. Application can be run on any desktop or mobile Web Browser. The audience collaboratively explores the artwork inside virtual canvas space within multi-contextual / conceptual creative layers by touching the virtual objects. These layers are not visible by default. Interaction is based on applying or viewing through some sort of "filters" (augmenting reality in virtual reality). Several participants can personally or collaboratively explore the hidden layers, as well as experimenting with the artwork through these layers without breaking the original artwork.  
For the implementation Open Source frameworks for Web Browser were used, especially LiveCoding.space SDK. During the development of the project there was implemented multi-user synchronization support for several open source frameworks across web browsers: multi-user 2D canvas in Two.js, synchronized Transport object in Tone.js. Also backported a video synchronization solution from Croquet V onto Virtual World Framework. MediaPipe and Hand.js were used for offline extracting of the body motion from the video performance. The project can be built from the source code and run locally without the need of internet connection, as it has no dependencies on any cloud services.
